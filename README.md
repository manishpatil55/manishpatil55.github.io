# Manish Patil — Personal Dev Portfolio

This is my personal dev portfolio — built while pursuing Computer Science and living in a college hostel.  
Between lectures, submissions, and hostel life, I carved time to craft something that reflects who I am — not just as a developer, but as a builder who loves logic, layout, and visual feedback.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I didn’t build this just to learn React.  
I built it to **test myself** — to go beyond what was shown and make something that feels alive, not copy-pasted.

The 5.5-hour video? It gave me the bones.  
But no animations, no scroll behavior, no dynamic visuals — no soul.  
So I did what devs do: I went in deep and made it mine.

Even today, when inspiration hits, I jump back in and build again —  
**No templates. No shortcuts. No AI-generated designs.**

---

## ⏳ The Process

> I **paused, rewound, rewatched, and rebuilt.**  
> Every. Time. It. Broke.

Most of the time went into:
- 🔁 Repeating sections that didn’t work  
- 🧩 Debugging layout bugs and animation mismatches  
- 🔍 Googling edge-case errors  
- 🛠 Fixing by trial, error, and coffee  

Not hard because of the code — but because of **college life + chaos + learning everything solo**.  
And it’s still not “done.” I keep improving it, because I care.
